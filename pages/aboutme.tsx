          It was the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) that led me to touch the
          beauty of open-source internet and finally got me to study Computer

          When I was in seventh grade, I was enthusiastic in messing with my
          Android device back and forth, including rooting, installing custom
          ROMs, recovering lost data. The process was challenging, but I could
          usually find a tricky way to work around on the online forums.
          Everyone in the community was truly excited to help and collaborate
          with others.

          I found these experience tremendously rewarding. As time goes by, I
          wanted to uncover the mechanism of these tiny but powerful software.
          To understand the programming fundamentals, I started with Java.
          Later, I learned more backend frameworks based on Java and got
          exposure to web development in Javascript. Now, I&apos;m learning to
          develop high impact system built on the cloud.
